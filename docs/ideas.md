# Ideas

## Future

- Scan, check and fix albums outside of library + add them to library
- Select albums based on track tags, recently accessed, other
- Support additional file formats
  - Comprehend standard tags (artist, album, title. track)
  - For MP4 (M4A, M4B, M4P) and other files
  - Add other extensions to scan
- More checks/fixes:
  - album art (missing, not in desired format, not the same on all tracks, too
    small/too large)
  - missing track-total
  - low bitrate or suboptimal codec
  - not all tracks encoded the same (file type or kbps target)
  - track filename doesn't match title, doesn't include track/disc number
  - album folder doesn't match album name
  - parent folder doesn't match artist if using artist/album
