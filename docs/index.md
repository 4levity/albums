# Get started

A Python wheel is not published yet. See [docs for Developing](./developing.md)
to install dependencies and use it.

If your music library happens to be in the operating system reported default
user music directory (e.g. `~/Music`) and you don't mind the `albums.db`
database file being created in the default user config directory (e.g.
`home/ivan/.config/albums/`), you can start immediately by running
`albums scan`. Otherwise, you need a configuration file. See [Usage](./usage.md)
